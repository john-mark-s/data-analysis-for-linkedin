# My marathon by the numbers
_October 25, 2024_

Three weeks ago, I ran and finished my first marathon. The 42,195 kilometers were the culmination of months of training, and, of course, having family and friends supporting on the day made a big difference! I finished the marathon in 5 hours 52 minutes and 50 seconds, a pace of 8 minutes 22 seconds per kilometer.
In December last year, I received the letter announcing I'd won a spot in the marathon, and began casually running for the first time. After some months of running about two times a week, I switched in May to a training plan for the marathon. In nine months of running, I ran a total of 815 kilometers, in 14 different cities and across 4 countries. From January to April, I ran between 21 and 40 kilometers a month. Then I dramatically increased the total kilometers to around 115 kilometers a month till July, and up to 150km in August and September (including the marathon itself). I did six runs of 21 kilometers or more before the marathon, running at a pace between 6:50 min per km to 8:12 min per km. My longest being a 32-kilometer run towards the end of August. I was also forced to skip some runs in July and August due to sickness, and a left-knee pain which surfaced in the beginning of September, which led me to reduce the kilometers and skip a few runs leading up to the marathon.

Race day arrived on September 29th. I joined the last of five start groups with 10 thousand runners. For the first two hours, I kept a pace between 7:06 min per km and 9:20 min per km. With so many runners, it was difficult to stick to a pace and decide what speed was the best. The first half I felt good at the pace I was going, but at times when I thought of going faster, I quickly reversed to a slower pace. According to the official marathon tracker, I ran the first 21 kilometers at an 8:00 min per kilometer pace.
After the first 21 kilometers, I began feeling a lot more tired, and couldn't imagine running the same length again. I kept my face down to not see the kilometer's marker each time, and focused on not stopping. My pace was still volatile, but steadily decreasing as the race continued. This is especially evident in the last 5 kilometers of the race, where I walked a few steps at the beginning of each kilometer out of exhaustion, but then I came back to life when the finish line came into view. From running between 9 and 12 minutes per kilometer, the last kilometer I sped up and finished in around 5 minutes. And this was the best part, because I vividly remember passing people right before we crossed the Brandenburg Gate, and most people were slowing down!

One of my ways to stay motivated during the training was to track my heart rate and, based on the distance or speed of the training, see how my heart rate responded to the workout. I also monitored my heart rate during the marathon. According to my watch, I spent 78% of the run in the anaerobic zone from 153 to 171 beats per minute (bpm), 14.7% between 134 and 152 bpm, and only 5% in the VO2 Max between 172 and 190 bpm. My key takeaway, is that, in theory, based on my heart track, I could’ve pushed myself more.

The greater takeaway, nonetheless, is to set a goal, create a plan, follow the plan, and although the result isn’t always what you expect or a perfect result, you get closer to the person you want to be, and you have fun in the process. The marathon is definitely one of the highlights of my year!
