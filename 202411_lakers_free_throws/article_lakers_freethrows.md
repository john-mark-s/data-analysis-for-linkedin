# The Lakers Late-Game Free Throw Struggles
_November 30, 2024_

Thursday, November 21st. 18 seconds are left in the basketball game, and Anthony Davis walks up to the free throw line with the game on the line. The Los Angeles Lakers were up by two points against the Orlando Magic, when Davis missed both free throws. On the next possession, the Magic scored a game winning 3 point shot with three seconds left on the clock. The discussions post-game focused around one topic: missed free throws. “It was a few years ago, when Anthony Davis really struggled late in games from the free throw line” shared Trevor Lane from the Laker Nation podcast on his episode, emphasizing that this game brought back bad memories for many fans. Nonetheless, Lane was quick to emphasize that AD has improved in late game free throws, but those games aren’t remembered. Let's explore how Anthony Davis' free throw shooting has progressed.
<br><br>Anthony Davis started this season on a strong note. He is playing aggressively, making shots, and is ‘the hub’ of the team’s offense. He is leading the team in points, rebounds, steals and blocks. His energetic play has also increased dramatically, and the number of fouls he’s drawing as well. Not only is he shooting a lot more free throws throughout the whole game, but this season, he’s attempted 17 more free throws than last year, and three times more than two seasons ago, at this point in the season.

Davis’ season free throw average, nonetheless, has dropped from 82% to 78%, and in the last four minutes of games, his free throw percentage dropped 16% compared to last year. At 70%, this season is trending towards being his second-worst late-game free throw percentage since the 2021-2022 season.

This season It is actually by design that Davis comes more into focus in late-game moments. JJ Redick has reiterated his intention to feed Davis the ball in the fourth quarter. For this reason, although Davis’ free throw percentage has decreased, he’s scored 10 more points from late-game free throws this season compared to last year, and 15 more than two years ago. It’s also possible, that the team's higher reliance on Davis throughout the whole game, and especially in the fourth quarter, is a cause for his late-game free throw struggles. When reviewing his game minutes, however, he's averaging about the same minutes per game this season compared to the previous two seasons. This could be further analyzed.
The whole team is also going to the line more often than in the previous three seasons and have maintained a 78% free throw shooting average. In the last four minutes of the game, however, the team has dropped their free throw percentage from 84% last year to 73% so far this season.

The key issues discussed following the Orlando Magic lose are late-game free throws. The flashbacks to two years ago, and losing games due to late-game free throws, are not unfounded. It looks like Davis’ late-game free throw shooting is dropping to his 2022-2023 season levels. But, there is still plenty of games left in the season, for this trend to impove. 
<br><br>Finally, for the Lakers to become a ‘championship-caliber’ team, as Redick announced in the pre-season, they need to not only maintain the volume of free throws they’re attempting, but also return to last year’s accuracy to fully benefit from their energetic, tough inside play and offensinve rebounding.
