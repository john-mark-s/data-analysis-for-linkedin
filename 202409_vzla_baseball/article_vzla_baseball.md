# Venezuelan Baseball Players - By the Numbers
_September 4, 2024_ on [LinkedIn]([url](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/venezuelan-baseball-players-numbers-john-mark-shorack-ki57e/))

Six Venezuelans participated in Major League Baseball's (MLB) All Star Game in Arlington, Texas two months ago. This led me down a rabbit hole of trying to find out where most Venezuelan baseball players come from, and some more interesting facts about the Venezuela-Baseball connection. Of course, at the moment, Baseball and other sports are taking a back seat in the country, due to extremely tense political situation. For the background to this, see my other recent post.

Venezuela is known as the third country with the most players in the US’ Major League Baseball league, only behind the United States and the Dominican Republic. Baseball as the main sport in Venezuela dates back to the 1920s and the US influence through oil companies in the country. The venezuela winter league was also known in the 20th century as a league where MLB players could go to practice in the off-season. Many well-known US-American players came to improve their skills, two emblematic ones being Pete Rose and Barry Bonds. 

Across Venezuela it’s common for kids to play baseball, not only as an organised sport, but out on the street. Whether it’s with beer bottle caps, rubber ball, or making their own baseballs by wrapping paper in rubber tape. It's also seen as a way to get out of poverty or improve your family’s standard of living. There are countless emblematic examples of this. Nonetheless, the data shows that most careers are not as glamorous or long-lasting as the ones we remember and celebrate.

478 Venezuelans have played in Major League Baseball since 1939, according to data extracted from Baseball Reference. In each decade the number of Venezuelan players has increased. From the 1930s to 1950s only a total of 6 players were Venezuelan. From the 1960s to 1980s between 10 and 28 players debuted each decade. This number tripled in the 1990s, and reached between 130-160 debuts in the following two decades. But debuts don't immediately correlate to a successful career or many earnings. 62,6% of retired Venezuelan players only played between 1 and 5 seasons in the league. 22% only played one season. Reaching the MLB professional league is extremely difficult, and having a successful career is even more challenging. Most of the players we read about seem in reality to be the exceptions to the rule. Only 67 players, or about 14%, had careers of ten years or more. The two players with the longest careers were Omar Vizquel (24 years) and Miguel Cabrera (21 seasons). 

If we look at the minor leagues, the data is even gloomier. According to The Baseball Cube, roughly 3550 Venezuelans have played in baseball Minor League farm system. Of those, only 13,45% have played in the professional Major League Baseball.

## From what parts of Venezuela do most Major League players come from?

Since the first Venezuelan player debut in 1939 four states in Venezuela have produced the most MLB players: the Capital District (Caracas), Carabobo and Aragua in the central region, and Zulia in the far-west. Zulia is one of the main states of oil production in the country, which could play a role in high levels of baseball in that region. For active players, Carabobo state has twice as many active MLB players as the next state. Second baseman Jose Altuve and catcher Salvador Perez, are two emblematic players from the state of Carabobo. The third state with the most active MLB players is Bolivar state in southeastern Venezuela.

A huge part of the success of Venezuelan players in MLB is because it’s been the main sport in the country for decades. The main rivalry of the Venezuelan league Caracas vs Magallanes is huge! Furthermore, there is a developed little league system across the country. Representatives from Zulia participate regularly in the Little League World Series, and won it in 1994 and 2000.

To conclude, I'm taking inspiration and support from Thomas Nestico and will do a pitching analysis on the two Venezuelan pitchers who participated in the 2024 All Star Game.

**Ranger Suárez** is in his 7th year as a professional pitcher, and earned his first nomination to an All Star Game this year. Based on the analysis I used from Thomas Nestico, Suárez has pitched in 22 games with an 11-6 record. His pitch velocity has an impressive wide range from the mid-70s (mph) for his Curveball and mid-90s (mph) in his fastball and sinker. Throughout the 2024 season, he's alternated his pitchers consistently for the most part. On average 32% of all his throws are a sinker, making it his most popular pitch, and close behind with around 20% are his curveball and fastball.

The second Venezuelan pitcher selected to the All Star Games was **Robert Suárez**, the third year closer playing for the San Diego Padres. He's pitched in 55 games, and saved 31 of them. He relies mostly on his fastball, which he uses 75% of the time and with an average velocity of 99 mph. More recently, however, his fastball usage went down, and he began throwing more sliders. Interestingly, all his pitches have a similar high vertical pitch break.

From both these graphics there is a lot more data than can be understood and interpreted, but for now I will leave it at that.

This article is a combination of historical and current data on Venezuelan players in Major League Baseball. If you found this article interesting, leave a comment or let me know what other types of analysis or research you'd want me to look into.
